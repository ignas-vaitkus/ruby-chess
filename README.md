# CLI Chess

2 player CLI Chess. Moves are made using Coordinate Notation. For example, to move with the e pawn, first, write down the square it is on and then the target square separated with a hyphen - "E2-E4", e pawn moves from square E2 to square E4.

## Usage

Install deps: `gem install bundler && bundle install`.  Run `bundle exec rake` to run the tests, or `bundle exec rake run` to run the program.
